      <p>I am a creative Web Developer who has had a passion for coding since I was 12 years old. With strong foundations in both Web Development and Computer Science, I take a curious approach in not simply writing code, but rather, understanding the foundation and structures behind websites and applications. I am excited by the opportunity to apply my theoretical foundations in helping a business build products that speak to the heart of consumerâ€™s needs.</p>
